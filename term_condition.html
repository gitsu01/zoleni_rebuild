            including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
            non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
            practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
            representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
            compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
            meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
            corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any representation or
            warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
            information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But
            in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.</p>
